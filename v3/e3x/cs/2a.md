Cipher Set 2a
=============

This profile is based on the algorithms used during the telehash v2 development process in 2013.

The required algorithms in this set are:

* **RSA 2048** - selected as a well known and highly trusted public key algorithm and size, used as the long-lived identity
* **ECC P-256** - a well known curve with many implementations, used for the ephemeral identity
* **AES 256-GCM** - trusted common implementations available

## Keys

When generating an endpoint including `CS2a`, the public/private keypair is [RSA 2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)).

Binary public keys are encoded in [DER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules) as X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structures.  (Most cryptographic libraries support this encoding; see [RFC 5280 section 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1) and [RFC 3279 section 2.3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.3.1) for more details.) 

The exchange ephemeral key is generated using [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) and the [p-256](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/dss/NISTReCur.pdf) curve, the resulting binary public key is [uncompressed](https://www.secg.org/collateral/sec1_final.pdf) (65 bytes).


## Message BODY

BODY bytes:

* `KEYS` - 256 bytes, PKCS1 [OAEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding) (v2) RSA encrpyted ciphertext of the 65 byte uncompressed ECC P-256 ephemeral public key and a 32 byte random AES key
* `IV` - 12 bytes, a random but unique value determined by the sender for each message
* `CIPHERTEXT` - [AES-256-GCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) encrypted inner packet and sender signature
* `MAC` - 16 bytes, GCM 128-bit MAC/tag digest (some GCM implementations auto-append this)

The `CIPHERTEXT` once deciphered contains:

* `INNER` - inner packet raw bytes
* `SIG` - 256 bytes, PKCS1 v1.5 RSA signature of the KEYS+IV+INNER

The `KEYS` is created by first generating a new ephemeral elliptic (ECC) public key for this exchange and a random 32 byte AES `KEY`, and then using the endpoint's RSA key to encrypt it *to* the recipient's RSA public key. The ECC keypair should be generated using the P-256 ([nistp256/secp256r/X9.62 prime256v1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239#page-4)) curve. The ECC public key should be in the uncompressed form 65 bytes in length (ANSI X9.63 format) followed by the 32 byte AES `KEY` bytes. The RSA encryption should use PKCS1 OAEP (v2) padding. The result is always padded to 256 bytes by OAEP.

The SIG is calculated from the concatenation of the `KEYS` (256 bytes of ciphertext), `IV` (12 bytes), and `INNER` (raw packet) together and then using the sender's RSA public key (SHA-256 hash and PKCS1 v1.5 padding) to create a signature of it, resulting in a 256 byte `SIG` value.

The `CIPHERTEXT` is created by encrypting the `INNER` and `SIG` (concatenated together) using AES-256-GCM.  The GCM IV/nonce parameter is the 12 byte (96-bit) `IV` value, and the key parameter is the 32 byte secret value following the ECC public key from the decrypted `KEYS`. The "tag" size for GCM is 16 bytes (128 bits), and the additional/auth data used to compute it is the 256 `KEYS` bytes, resulting in the `MAC` value appended to the original packet.


## Channel Setup

The channel encryption/decryption secret keys are generated by using [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie–Hellman) with the local ephemeral ECC private key, and the remote ephemeral ECC public key. Two secret keys are generated by performing a SHA-256 with the derived ECDH derived secret (32 bytes) and sent/received decrypted secret keys from the `KEYS` value (32 bytes each):

* channel encryption key: SHA256(ecdh-secret, sent-KEY, received-KEY)
* channel decryption key: SHA256(ecdh-secret, received-KEY, sent-KEY)

## Channel BODY

Channel packet binary `BODY` is defined as:

* `TOKEN` - 16 bytes, from the handshake, required for all channel packets
* `IV` - 12 bytes, a random but unique value determined by the sender for each message
* `CHANNEL CIPHERTEXT` - the AES-256-GCM encrypted channel packet
* `GCM TAG/MAC` - (GMAC) - 16 bytes, GCM MAC digest (some GCM libraries auto-append this with the AES-256-GCM cipher output)

The IV is 12 random bytes that must be different for every channel packet sent (incremented from a random seed) and used as the input to the GCM calculation, along with the appropriate encryption/decryption keys calculated for the exchange during setup.  The tag size for GCM is 12 bytes (96 bits) and no additiona/auth data is included as input to it.
