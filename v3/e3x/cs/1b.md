Cipher Set 1b
=============

> [DRAFT](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/labels/draft)

This is just a placeholder to define a hardware-accelerated friendly embedded CS.

-----------------

The base algorithms used in this set are chosen to be supported by commonly available hardware-accelerated-crypto on embedded hardware.

* **ECC NIST-P256**
* **HMAC-SHA256**
* **AES-128-CTR**
* or [CCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCM_mode) to replace CTR and HMAC? Contiki has started a [hardware-driver layer providing CCM](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/pull/557)
