# 802.15.4 - Device/Sensor RF Transports

There are a number of different transports that use [802.15.4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4) framing, typically for embedded devices and sensor networks.

Due to the nature of the low level RF framing, most of these transports have similar properties of a <127 byte frame and some minimal built-in per-frame acking and sequencing (low reliability).

In most cases, [chunking](../../lob/chunking.md) can be used to directly encode a packet to and from a series of frames between devices over these transports.
