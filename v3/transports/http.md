HTTP Transport
==============

Any endpoint may support a `http` path to maximize connectivity.  This is specifically useful when running inside a browser, or when an app needs to operate inside a highly restricted network that offers only HTTP/HTTPS.

This path is implemented using [socket.io](http://socket.io) (which handles all of the fallback and reconnect logic), and the only information needed to be exchanged is a `url` that can be `http://` or `https://`.

The `socket.io` interface is a minimal "msg" event being generated by either side, with it's argument being a single binary string of the packet that is always [cloaked](../e3x/cloaking.md) (for both HTTP and HTTPS).

By default all packets should be sent as `volatile` events, but handshakes may be sent as non-volatile and/or ask for an ack.

## Timeout

A new keepalive handshake may be automatically triggered when no packets have been sent for 60 seconds as an extra validation that the socket.io connection is valid.

## Path JSON

Example [path](../channels/path.md) JSON:

```json
{
    "url": "https://192.168.0.36:42424",
    "type": "http"
}
```
