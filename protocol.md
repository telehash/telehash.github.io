Telehash protocol draft
=================

# Introduction

> Note: This is the second major version of the Telehash protocol, the
> first one is deprecated and was a minimal experimental spec 
> to create a distributed hash table, it is a work in progress yet
> and unstable!

Telehash is a new encrypted mesh protocol enabling applications to
find, identify, and communicate directly with each other.  It is built
on public-key security (PKI) and fundamentally creates peer-to-peer
(P2P) connections using a distributed hash-table (DHT) to form the
mesh.

As a protocol, it does not provide direct end-user functionality or
application specifications. Instead, Telehash is primarily a tool for
developers of specifications and of libraries/SDKs to use in creating
modern applications which require rich experiences and private
interconnectivity at scale.

The principle idea that drove the creation and development of Telehash
is the belief that any application instance should be able to easily and
securely talk to any other application instance, whether they are two
instances of the same application, or completely different
applications. They should be able to do so directly, and in any
environment, from servers to mobile devices down to embedded systems
and sensors.

By enabling this freedom for developers as a foundation for their
applications, Telehash enables the same freedom for the people using
them - that the user can connect, share, and communicate more easily
and with control of their privacy.

The challenges and complexity today in connecting applications via
existing technologies such as APIs, OAuth, and REST is only increasing,
often forcing fundamentally insecure, centralized, and closed/gated
communication platforms.  By adopting Telehash in any application, that
application immediately has a powerful set of open tools for not only
its own needs, but can then also enable connectivity to and from
applications created by others easily. These tools include the ability
to have friends, sharing, feeds, tagging, search, notifications,
discovery, and other social patterns.

Telehash has a fundamental requirement to remain simple and
light-weight in order to support applications running on networked
devices and sensors. The design goals also include not forcing any
particular architectural design such as client-server,
centralized/federated/distributed, polling/push, REST, streaming,
publish-subscribe, or message passing... any can be used, as Telehash
simply facilitates secure connectivity between any two or more
applications.

# Protocol Details

## Glossary

  * **DHT**: Distributed Hash Table (based on [Kademlia][])
  * **NAT**: A device/router that acts as a bridge to internal IPPs
    (Network Address Translation)
  * **Hashname**: The unique ID of an individual application/instance
    using Telehash
  * **Packet**: A UDP packet less than 1400 bytes sent between any
    hashnames
  * **Switch**: The name of the software layer or service parsing
    packets for one or more hashnames
  * **Line**: When any two hashnames connect and exchange their identity
    to form a temporary encrypted session (like a VPN tunnel between
    them)
  * **Channels**: Dynamic bi-directional transport that can transfer
    reliable/ordered or lossy binary/json mixed content within any line

## Telehash Switches

In order to use Telehash in an application, the application will need
to include a software layer that talks to the Internet and processes
Telehash packets, known as a "switch".

It is highly recommended to use an existing switch library or service
for your environment, rather than creating one from scratch. This will
help insure that the security, identity, and networking aspects are
verified properly. If there isn't one which meets your needs, then we
would love your help - pull requests to list them here are welcome!

## Creating Applications

In addition to a switch, each instance of an application must generate
its own unique, private RSA keypair. This keypair is used to used to
identify and each application instance when communicating with other
applications.

An application must also bundle and optionally provide a mechanism to
retrieve a list of "seeds" - well-known and accessible DHT members.
This will be used to bootstrap and connect into the DHT. The entries in
this list will consist minimally of the public key, IP address and port
of each seed.

## Hashnames
Every instance of an application has a unique public id that is called
its "hashname". Any application instance can use the DHT to find
others by knowing their hashname. By default there is a single global
DHT, but Telehash also supports applications creating their own private
DHTs if needed.

The hashname, which identifies an endpoint within Telehash, is a
64-character hex string, formed by the [SHA-256][] digest of the DER binary
RSA public key. This key is required to have at least 2048 bits.

Since the DHT is based on Kademlia, this makes a [Sybil][] attack more
difficult, but not impossible. Additional techniques which are described 
later are used to further combat this attack when deciding which hashnames to
maintain in the bucket list.

Here's an example of how to create a hashname using Node.js:

``` js
var key = new
    Buffer("MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEArq38dvKzL5W2Qqp
    gQN7Ao5OWFhX04aIrYZH5sLjOzyI0gWZ6ZzpQifRk+L1yNU3nkotKfeQF5zzZvo4F7Y

    PG5QRe+54w94Xwp1l3VQdJaD+qRKBEG/hhSVqUHfRqVccNR4AV+q37XGDAupGc7YUJ6
    qnj7TnapQGrSno13IG+2PIhL3gB1lMWEGE/hwN1dxuUAXXsIgPU3KwIDAQAB",
    "base64");
var hashname =
    require("crypto").createHash("sha256").update(key).digest('hex');
```

## Packets

Packets are a foundational piece of the protocol. A packet uses JSON as
a core extensible and widely supported data format, but also must
support binary data transfer for efficiency.

Every packet must begin with two bytes which form a network byte-order
short unsigned integer. This integer represents the length in bytes of
the UTF-8 encoded JSON object which follows it. The JSON portion of the
packet is required, so the length must be at least 2 (the JSON document
`{}`), and less than the length of the raw UDP message minus the two 
bytes for length value.

Any remaining bytes on the packet are considered raw binary and
referenced as the 'BODY' when used in definitions below.

The format is thus:

    <length><JSON>[BODY]

An example of how to decode a packet, written in Node.js:

``` js
dgram.createSocket("udp4", function(msg){
    var length = msg.readUInt16BE(0);
    var js = JSON.parse(msg.toString("utf8", 2, length + 2));
    var body = msg.slice(length + 2);
});
```

### JSON

The JSON section of a packet often acts as a header of a binary payload.
The fields used vary depending on the context and are specified below,
but all top-level packets contain a `type` field with a string value.

### BODY

The optional BODY is always a raw binary of the remainder bytes between
the packet's total length and that of the JSON as indicated by LENGTH
above. Often a BODY is another full raw packet and will be decoded
identically to being read from the UDP socket, this pattern of one
packet enclosing/attaching another is how the RSA signatures and
encryption are implemented.

The BODY is also used as the raw (optionally binary) content transport
for channels and for any app-specific usage.

### Packet Processing

The Telehash specification as well as other applications may use
packets recursively, by embedding the (possibly encrypted) byte
representation of an inner packet into the BODY of an outer one. As a
result, switch implementations must be prepared to decode packets not
just from UDP messagess, but from a BODY or after decryption.

## Cryptography

Telehash uses several different cryptographic algorithms to secure traffic 
between applications. This section attempts to summarize the elements and how 
they are leveraged.

### Identification

Each application instance is identified by a hashname, which is derived from 
the instance's [RSA public key](rsa) via [SHA-256][] digest. This RSA key is 
represented in canonical [DER][] format, and there is no certificate or
trust chain information associated with the key.

Use of a node hashname derived from a public key (vs. one chosen randomly) 
makes a [Sybil][] attack more difficult, as you cannot target creation of
specific node identifiers. It does not make such attacks impossible, however.

For this reason, implementations must send DER-format RSA keys as the canonical 
form of their public key, and recipients (when processing [`open`](#open) and 
[`connect`](#connect) messages) must insure that the received key is in 
[DER][] format and that the received key indeed digests to the correct 
hashname.

### RSA Key pair

The application instance [RSA public key](rsa) is used to sign the body of 
[`open`](#open) packets to authenticate the sender. Incoming [`open`](#open) 
packets also contain the sender's [Elliptic Curve](ecc) public key, which is 
encrypted with the recipient's RSA public key. This EC public key is also used 
to derive an [AES][] key which partially encrypts the packet (see below). As 
a result, the RSA private key of the recipient is required to decrypt the 
packet.
  
A minimum 2048 bit key size is required for RSA keys. Implementations should
refuse to communicate with a party using shorter keys.
  
The algorithms used are RSA with [OAEP][] (SHA-1, MFG1, aka PKCS1 v2) for encrypting the 
sender's Elliptic Curve public key, and RSA with a SHA-256 digest and PKCS1 v1.5
padding for signing the encrypted inner packet.
  
The RSA public key of the recipient of an [`open`](#open) packet must be known.
There are normally three ways that you learn about the public key of a 
hashname:
  
* Public keys of any seed members must be known.
* You receive and decrypt the sender's public key as part of an [`open`](#open)
  packet
* You receive and decrypt the public key of an introduced peer as part of a
  [`connect`](#connect) request

Top level packets do not have any addressing, instead relying on the ip/port 
corresponding to a single hashname. You may be able to determine the sender of 
an [`open`](#open) packet by attempting to verify the embedded RSA signature 
against known public keys.

### Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
[Elliptic Curves](ecc) (EC) are used ephemerally to generate [`line`](#line) 
packet [AES][] keys. This is used to provide forward secrecy of line 
communication.

A public EC key pair is created when you send an [`open`](#open) packet. The 
[NIST P-256][] curve group (sometimes referred to as "prime256v1" or 
"secp256r1") is used for these keys. Due to fewer implementations, EC keys 
are exchanged in "[uncompressed][]" encoding.

The public key is exchanged encrypted with the recipient's 
[RSA public key](rsa) in an [`open`](#open) packet. It is also used as part of 
[`open`](#open) packet processing, as the [SHA-256][] digest of the public 
key is used to AES encrypt the inner packet.

These keys live until the line has been established or has failed. Generally 
retries of an [`open`](#open) packet will be identical (contain the same EC 
public key).

Once you have both sent and received [`open`](#open) packets, you use 
[Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman](ecdh) to derive a value that becomes that basis 
of the two line keys. The forming of the two line keys is described in the next
section.

<a name='aes' />
### AES
[AES][] is used to protect the inner data of an [`open`](#open) packet, as 
well as all line communication.

AES ciphers are created with a Counter algorithm mode ([CTR][]) and 
[PKCS1.5 padding](pkcs15). The counter is always zero, and not incremented as 
part of [channel](#channel) sequencing.

An Elliptic Curve public key is sent as part of an [`open`](#open) packet, 
encrypted with the recipient's [public RSA key](rsa). The [SHA-256][] digest of
this key is used to create an AES key which is used to encrypt the inner 
packet data, and another key is created to encrypt the attached signature.

Once [`open`](#open) packets have been exchanged, the two elliptic curves are 
used with [ECDH][] to derive a value used for the two line keys. A line key 
is formed by SHA-256 digest of the concatenation of the derived ECDH value, 
binary source line identifier, and binary destination line identifier.
This results in one key used to encrypt outgoing  packets, and a separate key 
used to decrypt incoming packets.

## Packet types
When a packet is being processed from a UDP message initially, it's
JSON must contain a `type` field with a string value of `open` or
`line`, each of which determine how to process the BODY of the packet:

 * [`open`](#open) - this is a request to establish a new encrypted
   session (a `line`) and contains the data to do so
 * [`line`](#line) - this is an encrypted packet for an already
   established session

Once a line is established, all packets sent thereafter within a line
must be part of a [channel](#channel) as the content-transport method
between any two hashnames.

<a name="open" />
### `open` - Establishing a Line

A packet of `"type":"open"` is used to establish a temporary encrypted
session between any two hashnames, this session is called a "line". You
must know the RSA public key of the recipient in order to send an
`open` message to them.

Every open packet requires the additional JSON keys of `open`, `iv`,
and `sig`, here's an example of the JSON part of the packet:

```js
{
    "type":"open",
    "open":"ZkQklgyD91XQaih07VBUGeQmAM9tnR5qMGMavZ9TNqQMCVfTW8TxDr9y37cgB8g6r9dngWLjXuRKe+nYNAG/1ZU4XK+GiR2vUBS8VTcAMzBcUls+GIfZU6WO/zEIu4ra1I1vI8qnYY5MqS/FQ/kMXk9RyzERaD38IWZLk3DYhn8VYPnVnQX62mE5u20usMWQt99F8ITLy972nOhdx5y9RUnnSrtc1SD9xr8O0rco22NtOEWC3uAISwC9xuihT+U7OEcvSKolScFI4oSpRu+DQWl19EAuG9ACqhs5+X3qNeBRMSH8w5+ThOVHaAWKGfFs/FNMdAte3ki8rFesMtfhXQ==",
    "iv":"60aa6514ef28178f816d701b9d81a29d",
    "sig":"o6buYor8o3YXkPIDJjufn9udfWDJt5hrgnVtKtvZI2ObOPlPSqlb2AdH6QsC7CuwtboGlt6eMbE7Ep6Js2CXeksXTCSZOJ99US7TH0kZ1H1aDqxYpQlM6BADOjG6YOcW+EhniotNUBiw3r02Xt4ohSm0wXxQ97JM95ntFBRnWr1vG25d+5pJQE4LyN2TwB4uApu9zeUoTPhF7daJQOcIMn9en+XxyuBsG61oR/x29bpaoZJGnKrk2DGH1jDnI5GpxIKUbT/Pa7QOlrICUCjGDgxy2TMQ+fiip5sIflxtFUPM/BV9mh4K7/ZaekJXTFfG2FKvJFytQkWbisDVy5EbEA=="
}
```

The required values of the open packet are defined as:

   * `open` - a base64 string value that is is created by generating a
     new elliptic (ECC) public key and using RSA to encrypt it *to* the
	 recipient's RSA public key. The ECC keypair should be generated
	 using the P-256 ([nistp256/secp256r/X9.62 prime256v1] 
	 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239#page-4)) curve. The key
     should be in the uncompressed form, 65 bytes (ANSI X9.63 format). The RSA encryption
     should use PKCS1 OAEP (v2) padding.
   * `iv` - 16 random bytes hex encoded to be used as an initialization
     vector
   * `sig` - a string created by first using the sender's RSA public key
     to sign (SHA256 hash and PKCS1 v1.5 padding) the attached
     (encrypted) binary body, then encrypt that signature (detailed below), then base64 encoded.

The BODY of the open packet will be a binary encrypted blob containing
another packet. The encryption is done using AES-256-CTR using the IV
value above. The AES key is formed by doing a SHA-256 hash of the ECC
public key in uncompressed form. 

Here's an example of the JSON content of this inner packet before
encryption:

```js
{
    "to":"851042800434dd49c45299c6c3fc69ab427ec49862739b6449e1fcd77b27d3a6",
    "at":1375983687346,
    "line":"8b945f90f08940c573c29352d767fee4"
}
```

The inner packet's required values are defined as:

   * `to` - which hashname this line is being created to
   * `line` - the unique id the recipient must use for sending any line
     packets, 16 random bytes hex encoded
   * `at` - an integer timestamp of when it was sent, used to verify another incoming open request is newer

This inner packet holds the sender's RSA public key as the BODY
attachment, in binary DER format.

#### Packet Generation

A rough order of the steps needed create a new open packet are:

  1. Verify you have the recipient public key. If you do not have the
     recipient's public key, you may need to trigger the recipient to
     connect to you first. This is done via a [`connect`](#connect),
     described later.
  2. Generate an IV and a line identifier from a secure random source,
     both 16 bytes
  3. Generate a new elliptic curve keypair, based on the "nistp256"
     curve
  4. SHA-256 hash the public elliptic key to form the encryption key
     for the inner packet
  5. Form the inner packet containing a current timestamp `at`, `line`
     identifier, recipient `hashname`. Your own RSA public key is the packet BODY in the binary DER format.
  6. Encrypt the inner packet using the hashed public elliptic key from
     #4 and the IV you generated at #2 using AES-256-CTR.
  7. Create a signature from the encrypted inner packet using your own
     RSA keypair, a SHA 256 digest, and PKCSv1.5 padding
	8. Encrypt the signature using a new AES-256-CTR cipher with the same IV and a new SHA-256 key hashed from the public elliptic key + the line value (16 bytes from #5), then base64 encode the result as the value for the `sig` param.
  9. Create an `open` param, by encrypting the public elliptic curve key
     you generated (in uncompressed form, aka ANSI X9.63) with the recipient's RSA
     public key and OAEP padding.
  10. Form the outer packet containing the `open` type, `open` param, the
     generated `iv`, and the `sig` value.
  11. If you have also received an open packet from the recipient
      hostname, you may use it now to generate a `line` shared secret,
	  using the ECC public key they sent in their `open` packet and
	  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).

An example of the generation of an open packet in Node.js is:

 ```js
 var eccSession = new eccKey("nistp256");

 var attached = {js:{}, body:myRSAPublicKey};
 attached.js.to = recipientHashname;
 attached.js.at = Date.now();
 var line = crypto.randomBytes(16);
 attached.js.line = line.toString("hex");
 var attachedRaw = packetEncode(attached);

 var open = {js:{type:"open"}};
 open.js.open = rsa(recipientRSAPublicKey).encrypt(eccSession.PublicKey, "PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING").toString("base64");

 var aesKey = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(eccSession.PublicKey).digest();
 var aesIV = crypto.randomBytes(16);
 var aesCipher = crypto.createCipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV);
 open.body = Buffer.concat([aesCipher.update(attachedRaw),aesCipher.final()]);
 open.js.iv = aesIV.toString("hex");
 aesKey = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(eccSession.PublicKey).update(line).digest();
 var aesCipher = crypto.createCipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV); 
 open.js.sig = Buffer.concat([aesCipher.update(rsa(myRSAPrivateKey).hashAndSign("sha256", open.body, "PKCS1_PADDING")),aesCipher.final()]).toString("base64");

 var openRaw = packetEncode(open);
 ```

#### Packet Processing
To process an `open` packet, the recipient will follow the following
rough order of steps:

  1. Using your private key and OAEP padding, decrypt the `open` param,
     extracting the ECC public key (in uncompressed form) of the sender
  2. Hash the ECC public key with SHA-256 to generate an AES key
  3. Decrypt the inner packet using the generated key and IV value with
     the AES-256-CTR algorithm.
  4. Verify the `to` value of the inner packet matches your hashname
  5. Extract the RSA public key of the sender from the inner packet BODY (binary DER format)
  6. SHA-256 hash the RSA public key to derive the sender's hashname
  7. Verify the `at` timestamp is newer
     than any other 'open' requests received from the sender.
  8. SHA-256 hash the ECC public key with the 16 bytes derived from the inner `line` hex value to generate an new AES key
  9. Decrypt the outer packet `sig` value using AES-256-CTR with the key from #8 and the same IV value as #3.
  10. Using the RSA public key of the sender, verify the signature (decrypted in #9) of
     the original (encrypted) form of the inner packet
  11. If an open packet has not already been sent to this hashname, do
     so by creating one following the steps above
  12. After sending your own open packet in response, you may now generate a `line` shared secret using the received and sent ECC public keys and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).

Example open packet validation logic in node (simplified):

```js
// generate these to identify the line being created for each sender
var myEccSession = new eccKey("nistp256");
var myLineId = crypto.randomBytes(16);

var packet = packetDecode(openRaw);

var open = rsa(myRSAPrivateKey).decrypt(packet.js.open, "base64", "PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING");
var senderEccPublicKey = new eccKey("nistp256", open);

var aesKey = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(open).digest();
var aesIV = new Buffer(packet.js.iv, "hex");
var aesDecipher = crypto.createDecipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV);
var attached = packetDecode(Buffer.concat([aesDecipher.update(packet.body),aesDecipher.final()]);

var line = new Buffer(attached.js.line, "hex");
if(attached.js.to !== self.hashname || !line) return; // must match recipients hashname and have a line

var senderRSAPublicKey = deciphered.body;
var aesKey = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(open).update(line).digest();
var aesDecipher = crypto.createDecipheriv("AES-256-CTR", aesKey, aesIV);
var sig = Buffer.concat([aesDecipher.update(new Buffer(packet.js.sig, "base64")),aesDecipher.final()]);
var valid = rsa(senderRSAPublicKey).hashAndVerify("sha256", packet.body, sig, "PKCS1_PADDING");
if(!valid) return;

// generate the aes session key used for all of the line encryption
var ecdheSecret = myEccSession.deriveSharedSecret(senderEccPublicKey);
var lineEncryptKey = crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(ecdheSecret)
  .update(myLineId)
  .update(line)
  .digest();
var lineDecryptKey = crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(ecdheSecret)
  .update(line)
  .update(myLineId)
  .digest();
```

#### Retransmission

A switch is usually initiating an `open` on behalf of the local application's request to open a channel to a remote application instance. The switch should therefore attempt to retransmit `open` packets at a reasonable rate if it hasn't received an `open` in response. A good rule of thumb is to send a maximum of 3 `open` packets, one second apart, and signalling a timeout to higher application layers if there is still no response.

Each `open` packet should use the same "at" timestamp for retransmission, but generate a new "iv" for the outer packet each time. In the event the remote switch receives more than one, this keeps the operation roughly idempotent.

Transmitting an `open` packet with a larger "at" timestamp (and ideally a new ecc shared key) will invalidate an existing line, and should be considered distinct from re-transmitting a request to open a new line.

<a name="line" />
### `line` - Packet Encryption

As soon as any two hashnames have both send and received a valid `open` then a line is created between them. Since one part is always the initiator and sent the open as a result of needing to create a channel to the other hashname, immediately upon creating a `line` that initiator will then send line packets.

The encryption key for a line is defined as the SHA 256 digest of the ECDH shared secret (32 bytes) + outgoing line id (16 bytes) + incoming line id (16 bytes).  The decryption key is the same process, but with the outgoing/incoming line ids reversed.

A packet with a `"type":"line"` is required to have a `line` parameter (such as
`"line":"be22ad779a631f63336fe051d5aa2ab2"`) with the value being the
same as the one the recipient sent in its `open` packet, and a random
IV value (such as `"iv":"8b945f90f08940c573c29352d767fee4"`) used for
the AES encryption.  This ensures that no line packets can be received
without being invited in an open. Any unknown ones are just ignored.

The BODY is a binary encoded encrypted packet using AES-256-CTR with
the encryption key that was generated for the line (above) and the 16-byte initialization
vector decoded from the included "iv" hex value.  Once decrypted (using the twin generated decryption key), the
recipient then processes it as a normal packet (LENGTH/JSON/BODY) from
the sending hashname.  All decrypted packets must contain a "c"
value as defined below to identify the channel they belong to (below).

<a name="channel" />
### `channel` - Content Transport

All data sent between any two hashnames (inside a line packet) must
contain a `c` parameter with a unique value (16 random bytes hex
encoded) determined by the sender for each channel.

A channel may have only one outgoing initial packet, only one response to it, or it may be long-lived with many packets exchanged using the same "c" identifier (depending on the type of channel).

Key parameters channel packets:

* `"type":"value"` - A channel always begins with a `type` in the first outgoing packet to distinguish to the recipient what kind of channel it is. This value must only be set on the first packet, not on any subsequent ones or any responses. Application-defined custom types must always be prefixed with an underscore, such as "_chat".
* `"end":"true"` - Upon processing a packet with an `end`, the recipient must not send any more content packets (reliability acks/resends may still be happening though) or expect anymore to be received and consider the channel closed. An `end` may be sent by either side and is not required to be sent by both.
* `"err":"message"` - As soon as any packet on a channel is received with an `err` it must be immediately closed and no more packets can be sent or received at all, any/all buffered content in either direction must be dropped. These packets must contain no content other than optional extra details on the error.
* `"_":{...}` - For any application-defined channels that have an underscore-prefixed type, any JSON values provided by or for the application are sent in the `_` key value.


<a name="unreliable" />
#### Unreliable Channels

An unreliable channel has no retransmit or ordering guarantees, and an `end` always signals the last packet for the channel with none in response. Any channel that is unreliable must not include any `seq` value (reliability signal below) in the initial `type` packet, and if one is received it must respond with an `err`.   Unreliable channels are also often referred to as "lossy" and "raw" as they provide no guarantees and switches may expose them in a very minimal interface.

The following values for `type` are for unreliable channels that are used to locate and communicate with
application instances on the DHT. They are part of the core spec, and must be implemented internally by all switches:

  * [`seek`](#seek) - return any pointers to other closer hashnames for the given `hash` (DHT), answer contains `see`
  * [`peer`](#peer) - ask the recipient to make an introduction to one of it's peers
  * [`connect`](#connect) - a request asking to try to open a connection to a given hashname (result of a `peer`)
  * [`relay`](#relay) - the capability for a switch to help two peers exchange connectivity information
  * [`path`](#path) - how two switches prioritize and monitor network path information

An example unreliable channel start packet JSON for an app:

```json
{
	"c":"ab945f90f08940c573c29352d767fee4",
	"type":"_hello",
	"_":{"custom":"values"}
}
```

#### Reliable Channels

Telehash packets are by default only as reliable as UDP itself is, which means they may be dropped or arrive out of order.  Most of the time applications want to transfer content in a durable way, so reliable channels replicate TCP features such as ordering, retransmission, and buffering/backpressure mechanisms. The primary method of any application interfacing with a switch library is going to be through starting or receiving reliable channels.

Reliability is requested on a channel with the very first packet (that contains the `type`) by including a `"seq":0` with it, and a switch must respond with an `err` if it cannot handle reliable channels.  Reliability must not be requested for channel types that are expected to be unreliable (like `seek` and `peer`, etc).

##### `seq` - Sequenced Data

The principle requirement of a reliable channel is always including a simple `"seq":0` integer value on every packet that contains any content (including the `end`). All `seq` values start at 0 and increment per packet sent when that packet contains any data to be processed.

A buffer of these packets must be kept keyed by the seq value until the receiving switch has responded
confirming them in a `ack` (below). The maximum size of this buffer and the number of outgoing packets that can be sent before being acknowledged is currently 100, but this is very much just temporary to ease early implementations and handling it's size will be defined in it's own document.

Upon receiving `seq` values, the switch must only process the packets and their contents in order, so any packets received with a sequence value out of order or with any gaps must either be buffered or dropped.  It is much more efficient to buffer these when a switch has the resources to do so, but if buffering it must have it's own internal maximum to limit it.

##### `ack` - Acknowledgements

The `"ack":0` integer is always included on any outgoing packets as the highest known `seq` value confirmed as *processed by the app*. What this means is that any switch library must provide a way to send data/packets to the app using it in a serialized way, and be told when the app is done processing one packet so that it can both confirm that `seq` as well as give the app the next one in order. Any outgoing `ack` must represent only the latest app-processed data `seq` so that the sender can confirm that the data was completely received/handled by the recipient app.

An `ack` may also be sent in it's own packet ad-hoc at any point without any content data, and these ad-hoc acks must not include a `seq` value as they are not part of the content stream.

When receiving an `ack` the switch may then discard any buffered packets up to and including that matching `seq` id, and also confirm to the app that the included content data was received and processed by the other side.

An `ack` must be sent a minimum of once per second after receiving any packet including a `seq` value, either included with response content packets or their own ad-hoc packets.  Allowing up to one second gives a safe default for the application to generate any response content, as well as receive a larger number of content packets before acknowleding them all.

##### `miss` - Misssing Sequences

The `"miss":[1,2,4]` is an array of integers and must be sent along with any `ack` if in the process of receiving packets there were any missing sequences, containing in any order the known missing sequence values.  Because the `ack` is confirmed processed packets, all of the `miss` ids will be higher than the accompanying `ack`.

This is only applicable when a receiving switch is buffering incoming sequences and is missing specific packets in the buffer that it requires before it can continue processing the content in them.

A `miss` should be no larger than 100 entries, any array larger than that should be discarded, as well as any included sequence values lower than the accompanying `ack` or higher than any outgoing sent `seq` values.

Upon receiving a `miss` the switch should resend those specific matching `seq` packets in it's buffer, but never more than once per second. So if an id in a `miss` is repeated or shows up in multiple incoming packets quickly (happens often), the matching packet is only resent once until at least one second has passed.

A switch MAY opportunistically remove packets from it's outgoing buffer that are higher than the `ack` and lower than the highest value in a `miss` array, and are not included in the array as that's a signal that they've been received.

##### Reliability Notes

Here's some summary notes for implementors:

* send an ack with every outgoing packet, of the highest seq you've received and processed
* only send a miss if you've discovered missing packets in the incoming seq ordering/buffering
* if an app is receiving packets and hasn't generated response packets, send an ack after 1s
* when an `end` is sent, don't close the channel until it's acked
* when an `end` is received, process it in order like any other content packet, and close only after acking + timeout wait to allow re-acking if needed
* automatically resend the last-sent un-acked sequence packet every 2 seconds until the channel timeout

### `"type":"seek"` - Finding Hashnames (DHT)

The core of Telehash is a basic Kademlia-based DHT. The bulk of the complexity is in the rules around maintaining a mesh of lines and calculating distance explained [below](#kademlia). The `"seek":"851042800434dd49c45299c6c3fc69ab427ec49862739b6449e1fcd77b27d3a6"` value is always another hashname that the app is trying to connect to.

When one hashname wants to connect to another hashname, it finds the closest lines it knows and sends a `seek` containing the hash value to them.  They return a compact `"see":[...]` array of addresses that are closest to the hash value.  The addresses are a compound comma-delimited string containing the "hash,ip,port" (these are intentionally not JSON as the verbosity is not helpful here), for example "1700b2d3081151021b4338294c9cec4bf84a2c8bdf651ebaa976df8cff18075c,123.45.67.89,10111".

The response `see` packet must always include an `"end":true`.

<a name="peer" />
### `"type":"peer"` - Introductions to new hashnames

For any hashname to send an open to another it must first have it's hashname, so there is a two step process starting with a peer request. Since new hashnames are discovered only from another (in the `see` values), they are tracked as a "via" so that they can be sent a peer request when a connection is being made to a hashname they sent.

This also serves as a workaround if any NAT exists, so that the two hashnames can send a packet to each other to make sure the path between them is open, this is called "hole punching." A peer request requires a `"peer":"851042800434dd49c45299c6c3fc69ab427ec49862739b6449e1fcd77b27d3a6"` where the value is the hashname the sender is trying to reach. The recipient of the peer request must then send a connect (below) to the target hashname (that it already must have an open line to).

These requests are always sent with a `"end":true` and no response is generated.

<a name="connect" />
### `"type":"connect"` - Connect to a hashname

The connect request is an immediate result of a peer request and must also contain an `"ip":"1.2.3.4"` and `"port":5678` with the values being of the peer requestor and a BODY of their public key.

The recipient can use the given IP, port, and public key to send an open request to the target.  If a NAT is suspected to exist, the target should have already sent a packet to ensure their side has a path mapped through the NAT and the open should then make it through.

These requests are also sent with a `"end":true` and no response is generated.

To avoid amplification attacks, the recipient should only send one [`open`](#open) per `connect` without any retransmission. It is left to the original initiator to send a new [`peer`](#peer) if any packets are lost.

### `"type":"relay"` - Guaranteed Connectivity

There are a number of situations where two different hashnames will be unable to connect directly to each other, and while these are not very common, the protocol must ensure that any two hashnames have the ability to securely exchange information.

The two most common cases are with combinations of certain NATs where at least one dynamically maps external ports such that the sending hashname has no way to detect it (often called symmetric NATs), and the other is when two hashnames are on the same local network and their shared NAT doesn't allow them to send public data to each other. Typical solutions in other protocols involve using a shared/trusted third party to relay the data via (TURN), and exchanging internal network addresses via a third party. There are additional cases that will become more common in the future as well, such as when there are diverse networks and two hashnames are on different ones entirely (one is ip based and the other bluetooth) connected only by a hashname that handles both.

When a hashname detects that it cannot connect directly with another (there are different detection techniques for the various cases), it sends a `peer` that also includes a `"relay":true` in the request. The hashname receiving the `peer` and generating the `connect` must include the relay flag in the connect request. Upon receiving a `connect` with the relay flag set in it, that hashname must additionally open a `relay` channel and send the identical `open` packet over the relay as well as sending it to the included ip/port info in the connect. If the relay is the only connectivity established, the subsequent `line` packets may be sent over it.

A `relay` channel is very simple, the initial packet must contain a `"to":"..."` of the hashname to relay to, and that hashname must be one that the receiving switch already has an open line to.  The initial relay packet is then sent as-is over the line to the recipient, and any/all packets sent from either side are then relay'd as-is to the other. The channel is unreliable and the relayed packets MUST NOT contain any reliability information.

To prevent abuse, all switches must limit the volume of relay packets between any two hashnames to no more than five per second from either sender.  Any packets over that rate MUST be dropped/discarded. This is a fast enough rate for any two hashnames to negotiate additional connectivity (like using a [bridge][]) and do basic DHT queries. Any relay state may be discarded after 10 seconds of inactivity.

### `"type":"path"` - Network Path Prioritization

Any switch may have multiple network interfaces, such as on a mobile device both cellular and wifi may be available simutaneously or be transitioning between them, and for a local network there may be a public IP via the gateway/NAT and an internal LAN IP. A switch should always try to be aware of all of the networks it has available to send on (ipv4 and ipv6 for instance), as well as what network paths exist between it and any other hashname. 
 
An unreliable channel of `"type":"path"` is the mechanism used to prioritize and test when there are multiple network paths available.  For each known/discovered network path to another hashname a `path` is sent over that network interface including an optional `"priority":1` (any positive integer, defaults to 0) representing it's preference for that network to be the default.  The responding hashname upon receiving any `path` must return a packet with `"end":true` and include an optional `"priority":1` with it's own priority for that network interface is to receive packets via.

The sending switch may also time the response speed and use that to break a tie when there are multiple paths with the same priority.

A switch only needs to send a `path` automatically when it detects more than one (potential) network path between itself and another hashname, such as when it's public IP changes (moving from wifi to cellular), when line packets come in from different IP/Ports, when it has two network interfaces itself, etc.  The sending and return of priority information will help reset which networks are then used by default.

When the [bridge][] extension is used, it also becomes an additional network path that can be shared/tested automatically.

#### `"alts":[...]` - Alternate Network Paths

Any `path` packet may also contain an optional `"alts":[{"type":"ipv4","ip":1.2.3.4,"port":5678},...]` array of objects each of which contains information about an alernate network path to it.  This array is used whenever the sender has additional networks that it would like the recipient to try using.

Each alt object must contain a `"type":"..."` to identify which type of network information it describes. This enables two hashnames on the same local network to decide to exchange their internal IP/Port and establish a local connection as the primary one. Current types of alts defined:

* `ipv4` - contains `ip` and `port` (typically the LAN values)
* `ipv6` - contains `ip` and `port` (to enable the recipient to ugprade if supported)
* `webrtc` - see [path_webrtc][]
* `http` - see [path_http][]

Upon receiving a path containing an `alts`, the array should be processed to look for new/unknown networks and those should be sent a path in return to validate and send any priority information.

# Switch Behaviors

Besides parsing the protocol, decoding the packets and processing the different channel types, in order to fully implement Telehash a switch must also internally track and respond with the correct behaviors to support both the DHT and manage the network quality and availability between itself and other hashnames.

<a name="kademlia" />
## Distributed Hash Table

Every switch must have both a startup/seeding routine and a background line maintenance process in order to properly support the Kademlia-based DHT.

The seeding process involves recursively performing a [seek](#seek) for it's own hashname against the list of seeds (provided by the app). The act of seeking ones own hashname will bootstrap lines to hashnames that are closest to it, and those hashnames then start to fill in the buckets.

The details of how [kademlia][] is implemented for Telehash are broken out into their own document.

## Line Maintenance

(this area in progress...)

A line may at any point become invalidated if the remote side is disconnected or restarts, so the process of detecting that and deciding to restart a line needs to be defined.

A simple rule to start is invalidating a line after it has been idle for more than 60 seconds or after sending channel packets and not getting any responses for more than 10 seconds (if the switch internally sends seek queries regularly and there's no replies, for instance).

If the switch knows that it is behind a NAT, for any lines that it want's to maintain as active it MUST send at least one packet out at least once every 60 seconds.

This logic will have to evolve into a more efficient/concise pattern at scale, likely involving regular or triggered `path` and `seek` requests, as well as differentiating between if an app is using the line versus the switch maintaining it for it's DHT.
